Note that In addition to the classes listed above, I also took a lot of College AP classes in High School. These are not listed here because they didn't pass off any program requirements. These courses only gave me college credit used toward priority registration at BYU. In the end I took 10 AP courses while in High School and scored 5s on almost all of them except for a few which I got 4s on.
