The Paschen Curve is a measurement of how much voltage it takes to ionize air at a specific pressure. For a project with another student, we decided to measure this with a vacuum system we had created. It was a lot of fun: We got to use a LABView interface and play with pretty high voltage. We gathered data and found that it matched relatively well to that already taken by others.
