This is a simple LABView program designed to take data of two DAQs quickly. A DAQ is a hardware device that connects to a computer and has many BNC and other connectors on it. It facilitates the retrieval of data quickly. For this project I needed something that could take data from two different DAQ BNC connectors. I ended up creating this solution. A release is included on my GitHub.
