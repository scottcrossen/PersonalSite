For this project I created an Android App that would take data from a server and then map the events in a person's family history. There were a few activities that I implemented. The first was a fragment within the main login. It would handle the necessary HTTP requests to log the user into the server and receive an authentication token.

Here's the service UI that was supplied to me and could be accessed on the localhost:

The map activity and fragment would display all events in a person's history. The lines designate that person's history. Different colors represent different things.

The search activity would search the received database for events and people. The display was shown in a "RecyclerView".

The filter activity would allow for the displayed events to be minimized based on user preference.

The settings activity is for... well... settings.

Overall it was a really interesting project and gave me practice with web requests, GUI configuration in android, and also google maps development.
