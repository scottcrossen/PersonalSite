The Mckay School of Education of BYU has a large amount of faculty and student computers that they own. Though I was primarily the server administrator for the college, I also assisted with software deployments and computer management for the school as needed. We mostly used professional software like Casper and SCCM to image and maintain the machines, but we also used numerous other software solutions particular to our situation.
