PID - and also PI - Controllers are a robust way to handle a variety of hardware and instruments. They're very versatile and primarily work through a feedback system that works through feeding the latest data through discrete **P**roportional, **I**ntegral, and **D**erivative components with various weights to solve for the new output on the controlling hardware. In this project, I successfully implemented a solution to maintaining a diode at a constant temperature (the diode was configured to be used as a thermometer with constant current and variable voltage corresponding to relative temperature). To do this, I created a simple enclosure for the diode which was soaked in ice water and had a heating coil wrapped around it which also had it's voltage controlled by a NI DAQ. Though LabVIEW supplies it's own PID modules, I built my own and even created the functionality to have the controller switch between temperatures after dwelling on one for long enough. Finally, I also had some fun with liquid nitrogen introduced to the system by a servo motor which was also attached to the DAQ and controlled by LabVIEW. If the program's parameters changed such that it had to cool the system rapidly it would release the liquid nitrogen and add heat accordingly. And, as a tradition whenever i have extra liquid nitrogen, I also made ice cream with it to celebrate a great PID controller implementation.
