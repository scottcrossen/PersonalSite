When I was 12 years old I received my first ham radio licences. Callsign: ke7mla. Class: Amateur Extra. Ever since then I have been an avid ham enthusiast. I have participated in many field days and other uniquely amateur radio activities. I still try to use my radio when I'm able. In fact, I've applied many of the techniques I've learned to what I currently do for research and work.
