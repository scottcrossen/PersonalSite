I worked for the McKay School of Education (of BYU) doing their computer support. During this time I was solely in charge of their server administration. I managed both physical and virtual servers. In total we had more than 40 machines that I controlled which all had some different function for the school. During my time working there, we probably had a total down-time of our production servers of less than 2 minutes between all of them put together. Most of them were based in Ubuntu+LAMP, but some of them ran windows server. We even had two mac servers that were produced when apple was still into that sort of thing. I am now very familiar with most server and DNS administration tools and can navigate complex network systems with ease.
