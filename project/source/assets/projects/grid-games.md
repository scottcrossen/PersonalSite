I was was recently challenged to build the game 2048 in under one hour. Well I did -- but it was a very crude implementation. Because I can't leave things alone, I later decided to polish it up. Not only did I make the basic Javascript nicer, but I also stuck it in JQuery, and made some custom styles.

Since I still couldn't leave it alone I also made a slide-puzzle-type game so you can play two games with the same button clicks. I also built this game in under one hour. (It was probably closer to 30 minutes because I already had the other to work off of.)

The result looks good on a desktop. Note that the game is played off of the arrow keys so it can't yet be played on a mobile browser. It's currently hosted on my Google Cloud storage at http://games.scottcrossen.com

Feel free to play them! See if you can win both at the same time.
