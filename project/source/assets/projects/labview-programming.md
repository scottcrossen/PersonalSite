This is an on-going project. The lab I work for has a large amount of laboratory instruments that interface with the LabVIEW software. It is beseeming and desirable to be able to set-up scanning-programs that can handle and vary any of our input-type instruments and read the output off any of our output-type devices in a systematic fashion. The overall program needs to be robust and expandable for when we get new equipment. For this reason, a scanner-program was designed to orchestrate the process of varying the input over a range and reading the output. Currently, I am working on expanding this software to include more drivers as well as to have the functionality of creating a two-dimensional scan where two input-type instruments are varied and the output is correspondingly read and recorded.
