For this project I put a new spin on an old classic: asteroids. The app has 3 main parts. The first allows the user to import different level sets and ship parts into the game's sqlite database from a json. The second part allows the user to configure his/her ship. Parts like the engine or power core also add different stats to the ship such as speed or power. This section can be skipped if desired, and a random ship will be chosen. The last part was, of course, the game play. Admittedly, rotating the ship along with all of its parts was a bit of a challenge for a first-timer, but the rest was pretty straightforward. To make it better than classic asteroids, I drew beautiful background images, planets, and nebulae. I also made a mini-map that shows the location of the user and asteroids. There are also different kind of asteroids: growing, regular, and asteroids that split into eight sections. The project is hosted on my GitHub.
