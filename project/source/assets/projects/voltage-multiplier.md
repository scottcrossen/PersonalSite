A Cockroft-Walton multplier is a robust voltage multiplier simply obtained by an array of capacitors and diodes. It is  commonly used in many applications in physics and computer engineering to obtain high voltage from relatively low voltage. There exists two basic types of Cockroft-Walton multipliers: the full wave multiplier, and half-wave multiplier. It has been noted that the efficiency of the the multiplier decreases as the stages of the multiplier increases.

For a project that a classmate and I did, we tested this exact statement by characterizing the inefficiency of these multipliers given different parameters. We attempted to maximize efficiency by optimizing the design of the Cockroft-Walton multiplier by observing trends of efficiency versus frequency, capacitance and number of stages. In the end, we were able to come up with detailed plots of gain vs parameters plotted in a multi-dimensional space. Hopefully, these results will lead to better multiplier design in the future.
