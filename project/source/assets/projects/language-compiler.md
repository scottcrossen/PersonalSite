This article is about a database-querying language I created called Datalog.

Datalog is a type of database description language similar to SQL that uses such things like graph theory and relational algebra to fulfill queries. I created this project over the course of a few months to show that I understand basic Computer Science. This program reads in a text file describing a relational database, checks syntax by comparing it to a grammar, builds a database, processes "rules", and fulfills queries. It outputs the queries to another text file. The project is hosted on GitHub.
