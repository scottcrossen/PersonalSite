Recently, IBM has released a cloud-based quantum computer available for the public to program. I was one of the first that registered for this opportunity. I now have technical experience in working with real architecture on graphical quantum computer programming languages. I mostly have used the software in conjunction with the research I'm doing - electron spin coherence - to probe the coherence times of the qubits they used. However, I am now very fluent in the language of quantum computing - both in single qubit operands and entanglement operands.
