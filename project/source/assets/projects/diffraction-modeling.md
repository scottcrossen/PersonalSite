During my freshman year of college I wanted a project that would demonstrate my ability to program in Mathematica. I chose to implement a solution to modelling diffraction through a variable grating. I created a module that would display the fraunhofer-domain output image given certain necessary parameters like wavelength and pattern domain size. The program even was able to process binary-bit maps and display the results in a spherical graph. I used the program to display the output of what a llama-shaped grating would look like. Not surprisingly, it looks similar to a wide-slit with a few other harmonics.
