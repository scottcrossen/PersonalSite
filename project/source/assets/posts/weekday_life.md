Thanks to Google's generosity, I now have a Pixel 2 XL to take pictures with!

So yeah, I work for Google now. I originally started work in the main campus in Mountain View CA but have since moved into San Francisco where I joined a product-team called Firebase. Here's pictures of where I work:

The view from my floor:

People ask me all the time "how's work at Google"? Well, first, it's still work, but it's not as bad as most places. There's a lot of exploring that you can do because campus is so big

I've also met cool people during Work. Below is a picture of Sir Roger Penrose.

Hours are flexible so when my friends are in town I take a few hours off during the day to tour San Francisco. I walk around The City a lot these days. Oh, and the San Francisco Office has a photo booth:

I'm sure I could write an exhaustive list of all the things that Google gives it's employees but that would pretty exhausting for me to write and even more boring to read.
