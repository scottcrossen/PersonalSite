Summer started out great this year. BYU's campus is very pleasant to hang around at this time of year. So is anywhere in the main salt lake valley.

This summer I'm working at a company called *Blue Matador*. It's really fun! My coworkers are awesome and really smart. On my way to work in June there was a freak snowfall for some reason. I've included pictures of that too.

I've also been fishing a few times this summer. As gross as Utah Lake is, it's really easy to catch fish in. You can reel them in on every other cast!

Last but not least: my brother and I found a coin-op of one of our childhood favorites: *Warlords*.
