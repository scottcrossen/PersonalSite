This semester was very busy for me. Normally I take more than 20 credits/semester but this semester I only took 18 and was still busy. I still managed to do some things during the few moments I had between midterms
and projects.

I attended a concert at the Velour. One of the performers was part of the band "Neon Trees". She is shown
in the middle picture.

I also visited the tabernacle display on BYU's campus. I touched the Arc of the Covenant and didn't die.

I found a nice trail up Provo canyon.

I also spent a lot of time hanging with my brother and friends. I also participated in a few "hackathons".
