Between the winter and spring semesters I had about a full two weeks of school break! It was really awesome. I took full advantage of the time and went on a trip to southern Utah and visited some national parks there with my friend.

I love backpacking. It's probably my favorite thing to do in the outdoors. We got to do plenty of it in the national parks.

We got to see some cool places too. Sometimes we would just stop off the side of the road and discover things like TeePees. Sometimes we just enjoyed the vast skies.

I got plenty of sun though. Much of southern Utah is just desert and rock which is a problem when you forget to apply sunscreen.

Probably the best thing though was that it was always an adventure! We never knew what we were going to do next. In truth we had originally planned to do a 20 mile backpacking trip to a back-country lake where we would spend a few days fishing. After discovering that the lake was frozen over we ended up on a road trip to the national parks in southern Utah.

We found some cool rock formations too.

One night we camped on the side of a cliff looking over all of Bryce Canyon. It was so beautiful and serene. You could see for miles. It was by far the best camping spot I've ever discovered. Knowing there was a 100 yard drop was a bit unsettling though.

And finally, there were lots of cool vistas and clear blue skies. It was such a nice change from the city where I had been for the past year attending school.
