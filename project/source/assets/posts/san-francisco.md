Note: this blog post represents the first (1/3) part of a road trip I went on during the summer of 2017.

This summer my friend Tyler Kharazi and I decided to visit a few places in California. We started our journey in San Francisco which was just amazing. The night we got there we went to "In-N-Out Burger" and then toured the mission district to listen to the local music scene. It was really relaxing.

Touring the city was really fun. We wen't to "Boudin's" for lunch and had some clamchowder in a sourdough bread bowl. We also watched the sailboats in the bay. It was really interesting to watch all the people trying out wind surfing (something I'm now going to have to try out)

And of course I got to visit the golden gate bridge.

Not shown is the really bad sunburn I got while touring all the sites. Right before we left San Franscisco we went and toured my brother Mark's work place. He works at Facebook and we got a free breakfast out of him because of that.
