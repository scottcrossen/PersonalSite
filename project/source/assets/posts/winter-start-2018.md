I am currently registered for only 12 credit hours this semester -- the minimum
amount that will qualify me for grants and scholarships. Because of this I have
plenty of time to do fun things!

I went snow-machining with some friends.

We stayed in one of their family cabins near Park City Utah.
It was next to a great view.

We also did some really extreme sledding: It was super dangerous.

I also went to another concert at 'the complex' (SLC). The headliner was
Ron Pope (who was amazing) and one of the openers was The National Parks (who
have always been a favorite of mine).

I've also been just relaxing with friends for a good portion of my time. It's a
great life.
