I hope this post doesn't seem excessively boastful, bumptious, or conceited. I think everyone has their strengths -- Mine just happen to be in academics. However, since this site is primarily a personal portfolio, I'm going to include all of this information in spite of the unwanted arrogance it evinces.

BYU hosted their first annual 24-hr hackathon this year from March 23rd to March 24th. It was a lot of fun! I built the project described [at this link](http://localhost:9000/#/projects/28). At the end of the 24 hours, my project was rated as the best in show by the panel of Googlers that were in attendance. I won some cool prizes because of that such as a Google Home and a Google Chromecast. I guess this means that I'm the best hacker at BYU. Below is a picture of the event at 2 a.m.

I also graduated this April with my twin brother Mark! He graduated last December with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. He works at Facebook and flew back just for this event.

So I guess this is where the bragging comes in: I graduated Summa Cum Laude (Valedictorian) with two majors in Physics and Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I've published a few times, I've presented my research at conferences a few times, I have a technical internship experience, I have a 4.0 GPA, I usually took 18-21 credit-hours each semesters, and I am a member of Phi Kappa Phi (the premier honor society at BYU). I did this all within 8 semesters while usually working the maximum amount allowed by BYU.

One fun tradition that the BYU physics department does is the annual balloon-pendulum challenge. In this challenge, graduating physicists take the balloons from the banquet tables and try to float them into the ceiling hole where the pendulum extends from. I got mine in first try. A lot of other physics programs around the country also participate in this rite so it was fun to participate in at BYU!

During graduation my name was listed in the program three times. I've included all of the occurrences here.

The weekend after graduation I also went out shooting rifles with some friends.

For some reason one of my friends had an assault rifle. I tried that out too.

So what's the next step for me? Well, I accepted a job at Google in the bay area. I will start there in the middle of July. However, one thing I regret about my time at BYU is caring too much about things that don't matter -- such as grades, achievements, and anything that requires long hours of self-discipline at the cost of enjoying life and the outdoors. I honestly think that my academic and professional pursuits detracted from the other more important aspects of my life. Because of this I want to spend the next few years of my life making up for the time I've felt like I've wasted over the past four years. My itinerary includes living in a van, spending my weekends traveling, cycling, and enjoying the outdoors in whatever way I can. Though I'm sure that Google well be really enjoyable to work at, that's not the next step for me -- the next step is leaving Provo behind and spending more time doing the things I enjoy.

Oh yeah, I also bought a like-new van! My intent is to outfit it into a conversion van with a mattress and other necessary things. Many people in the bay area already live in their vans as an alternative to the [3,000/month average rent](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-mateo-county/san-mateo/), but I will probably do it not as a means to save money but because that's just the lifestyle that appeals to me. For the next portion of my life I've decided to do things the way I want and that includes living in my van, using Google's amenities (free gym, shower, food, rubber ball pits, etc.), and traveling whenever I want -- regardless of what other people think.

One final thing: As I just graduated, I want to thank a few people who have helped me get here. This includes my brother Mark, my real twin brother Caleb Galovich, my parents, my other brothers (including the one that's female), my adventure buddy Tyler Kharazi, my thesis adviser Dr. Colton, my teacher Eric Akins, my coworkers and research partners, all of my friends and roommates, the people of South Carolina, and everyone else who has ever had to put up with me: thanks!
