WARNING: This post may seem excessively boastful, bumptious, or conceited. Please forgive me for this in advance. I think everyone has their strengths -- Mine just happen to be in academics. However, since this site is primarily a personal portfolio, its probably acceptable for me to include this information anyway.

BYU hosted their first annual 24-hr hackathon this year on March 23rd-24th. It was a lot of fun! I built the project described [at this link](http://localhost:9000/#/projects/28). At the end of the 24 hours, my project was rated as the best by the panel of Googlers that were in attendance. I won some cool prizes because of that such as a Google Home and a Google Chromecast. I guess you could say that I'm the best hacker at BYU just from this isolated incident. Below is a picture of the event at 2 a.m.

I also graduated with my twin brother Mark! He graduated last december with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. He works at Facebook and flew back just for this event.

So I guess this is where the bragging comes in: I graduated Summa Cum Laude (Valedictorian) with two majors in Physics and Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. I've published a few times, I've presented my research at conferences a few times, I have a technical internship experience, I have a 4.0 GPA, and I am a member of Phi Kappa Phi (the premier honor society at BYU). I did this all within 8 semesters.

One fun tradition the BYU physics department does is the annual balloon-pendulum challenge. In this challenge, graduating physicists take the balloons from the banquet tables and try to float them into the ceiling hole where the pendulum extends from. I got mine in first try. A lot of other physics programs around the country also participate in this rite so it was fun to participate here!

During graduation I got my name listed in the program / playbill three times. I've included them here.

The weekend after graduation I went out shooting rifles with some friends.

For some reason one of my friends had an assault rifle. I tried it out too.

I also bought an [almost] new car too. My intent is to outfit it into a conversion van with a mattress and everything to go camping or live in. Many people in the bay already live in their vans as an alternative to the [3,000/month average rent](https://www.rentcafe.com/average-rent-market-trends/us/ca/san-mateo-county/san-mateo/), but I will probably do it not to save money because that's just the lifestyle that appeals to me -- I want to be able to travel and see places on a moment's notice and this will allow me to do that. In the end I wish that I did my undergraduate slightly different. I think my academic and professional pursuits detracted from other aspects of my life. For the next portion of my life I've decided to do things my way and that includes living in my van if I want regardless of what other people think.
