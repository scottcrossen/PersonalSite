I was invited to interview with Microsoft this semester. It honestly wasn't all that special.
They were interviewing thousands of candidates pulled from all over the country.
In the end I wasn't offered a position, but I'm happy with that for a variety of
reasons not discussed here. I still got to enjoy a few days in Seattle though.

I found a statue in Microsoft's headquarters and went to a Brazilian restaurant
called "Fogo De Chao" with a few of the guys that I interviewed with.

I also toured downtown seattle.

There's a famous restaurant called "Ivar's" that I ate at. Afterwards I fed the ducks in Bellevue.

It was an exciting few days but I sadly had to go back to Provo.
