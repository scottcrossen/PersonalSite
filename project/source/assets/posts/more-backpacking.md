For the first time ever (I think) BYU gave us a day of spring break. To take advantage of this monumental occasion I decided to head south with a few friends to go backpacking. It was a lot of fun.

However, one of the major problems I have with Utah is the show-off culture of everyone here. We could have gone to a nicer park like Arches or Zion but we knew that those parks would be inundated with picture-seekers who only do things so they can appear cool on Instagram, Twitter, or even Facebook. It might seem hypocritical for me to say that (because of this blog) but I believe that the underlying motivation is what is fundamentally different between me and them and what sets me apart from the majority of those charlatans.

Anyway, we ended up backpacking around Canyonlands National Park. It was allright. Definately not my favorite trip I've been on though.

The vistas were spectacular though.

We camped out at the bottom of a canyon and saw an awesome sunset as well.

When we got back to Provo it was the perfect weather for exploring. BYU supposedly has this tunnel system that connects all of the buildings on campus. It's purpose is to provide heating and water to all of these buildings. It is even alleged that these tunnels go as far north as the MTC. One item on my bucket-list has always been to get into these tunnels. After my backpacking trip I did exactly that: I got in.
