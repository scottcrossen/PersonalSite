This year the APS Four Corners conference for research in Physics was held at
Colorado State University. Like last year, I attended the conference to present my
research on the same topic that I am writing my thesis on. I found that Colorado
is a very nice place. The sunsets were amazing every day I was there. I took some poses
with the scenery:

Campus was really nice. It was MUCH better than BYU's campus where I currently attend. While walking to
a local destination, my friend and I found a really large quad. The last one is a picture of someone doing
the splits.

My presentation was short and sweet.

On the way home I found a cowboy hat and horse.
