This Summer I went on quite a few hikes, but the best by far was the adventure I took up on Mt. Timpanogos. I went with a few friends from the Physics department including my research advisor. Here’s a picture of all of us:

It was around a 15-mile trip that gained 4815 feet but It was well worth it. Honestly, I didn’t even get sore afterwards. Here’s the pictures of the valley from both sides of the summit:

There were a lot of people there. The trail is very popular in Utah. The final picture is of me standing victoriously sometime during the trip.
