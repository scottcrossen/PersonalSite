This semester has been great so far. I'm registered for 21 credits, I work as much as BYU allows, and I've still been able to do the things I enjoy!

Among other things, I've enjoyed a few long car trips with my brother Mark and our truck "Ol' Blue".

I also participated in the Rex Lee run which helps funds cancer research at BYU. I didn't have my phone on me so the first photo below is taken from BYU's no-longer-daily *Universe* magazine.

I've also been to a few more concerts recently. The most notable was for a band known as *The National Parks*.

Of course, Sydney Macfarlane and Brady Parks crushed it as per their usual.

I went with my brother Mark who seemed to enjoy it as well. All of the music was remarkably well performed and sounded very close to their studio recordings. In fact, *The National Parks* don't use any digital synths and it really makes their music sound that much greater in-person.

The only bad part was the long lines and crowd. Overall it was a great concert though.

I also saw *Brumby* and *Foreign Figures* who were also great. Here's some picture of them. The first two photos are *Foreign Figures* and the last is *Brumby*
