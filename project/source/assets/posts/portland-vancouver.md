After spending Christmas with my parents and brother in Spokane, we visited my
sister in Vancouver. While there, we drove over the river and toured Portland.

There's weird statues in Portland but cool bike stores. We bought a bike.

We toured Vancouver with my niece and nephew too.

Turns out my nephew is quite the photo-bomber.

We spent new years with my Sister's family as well. This picture is of me and my dad
with my nephew doing is typical photo-bombing.

We left for home and drove through central washington. I took a plane from the Spokane
airport to salt lake so that I could finish school. This picture is of the Boise Airport.
