The summer is coming to an end. I enjoyed it immensely.

The majority of the time I spent working for a company called "Blue Matador" in Herriman.

I did a few more hikes, but I didn't do any more backpacking.

I also biked 20-40 miles everyday during my commute. Sadly I got nailed by a car and now my bike is totaled.

But mostly I just chilled with my friends. Usually at the pool!
