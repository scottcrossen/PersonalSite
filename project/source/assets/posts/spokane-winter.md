This year (November 2016-January 2017) I finally had a little bit of time to relax during the short time between my school semesters.

It started with thanksgiving which was just great! I spent it with my brother and sister-in-law who lived in Salt Lake City. My brother just finished his masters in food science so he cooked an awesome meal! It was probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time. I cracked open my favorite type of ginger-ale to celebrate the occasion.

BYU has a testing center, and during finals the line always gets rather long. This picture shows one portion of it during finals week. It got longer but I didn't have a camera to take a picture of it at that time.

I flew back to Spokane to spend the majority of my school break. I enjoyed hanging with friends, playing board games with other friends, and of course playing my childhood-favorite "Joust" at the arcade.

On the return trip to Provo I took this awesome photo in the Boise Airport.

Well, I'm ready for another semester of exorbitant amounts of cereal and long-hours of research in my lab. Overall, those are probably the two main things that best describe my college career.
