In the winter of 2016 I was privileged to speak at the "Spring Research Conference" put on by the College of Physical and Mathematical Sciences at BYU.

Then in October of 2016, I was invited to New Mexico State University along with some of my research partners to present on what we do. This is a picture of us in Albuquerque as we passed through on our home-trip from Las Cruces:

We had to leave on a bus that left at 1:00 am. It was a super long trip. Eventually we made it.

The Hotel was nice.

My presentation went great too! This picture makes it look like no one was there, but there definitely were quite a few people. Just nobody sat in the first two rows.
