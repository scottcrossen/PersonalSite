As part of a three day weekend that BYU gave us during February (President's Day), me and two buddies (Tyler Kharazi and Colter Stewart) did a three-day backpacking trip into the famous "Coyote Gulch" of southern Utah. The trip was very technical but also very rewarding. There were a few "rappelling" stages and also a ton of rocks to navigate around on the canyon floor. We spend two nights in the canyon.  

Apart from just enjoying the outdoors, we also got pretty close to dying: After the second day we set down our backpacks and went day-hiking with our fishing poles to find some good spots on the escalante river. On our way back we got stuck on very sheer rock faces that cut off into a very deep chasm. We had to get across the multiple faces or else we would risk the rapidly decreasing weather without our gear (hypothermia was a very real threat). Any slip and it was death in the canyon below. Somehow we got across the rock faces on our first trip out, but on our way back the conditions were much worse. It was very perilous but somehow I got across and ran back to camp and got our rope in time to help the other two across. It was probably the second most dangerous time in my life.

There were plenty of cool arches:

I got to spend the time with one of my favorite adventure buddies Tyler Kharazi.

A lot of great hiking and adventuring. I have no shame - here's some more cool pictures:

Unfortunately I lost my camera, or else I would also show the more technical aspects of the hike (We had to use rope on parts).
