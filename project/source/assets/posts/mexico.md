As a last-hurrah before school starts, some friends and I went to Puerto Pe√±asco (Rocky Point) Mexico.

It was great fun. We lived off street tacos and spent most of our time on the beach.

We also played "spike ball".

Not shown here is the time when we got pulled over by a Mexican cop who demanded a bribe from us. I also didn't include pictures of the drive back to Provo where we broke down in Cedar City Utah for a night at the same time that I had food poisoning. That wasn't enjoyable.
