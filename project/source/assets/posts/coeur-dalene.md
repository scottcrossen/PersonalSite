I had six finals this semester, but I still managed to finish on Wednesday.
It looks like I managed to pull of another 4.0 this semester. On Thursday I
rode to the airport with my roommate Scott Mckenzie (who is not the same as the
famous artist who wrote the song *San Francisco*).

I went back to Spokane this winter. One of the lakes in the area is called Coeur d'Alene Lake -- a
place where I actually used to work one summer as a Boy Scout Archery Director.
This year they were having record numbers of bald eagles in the area. I decided to
check them out. It was interesting to see the eagles go fishing. Below is a picture of three
bald eagles in a tree.

And here is a shot of the beautiful Coeur d'Alene scenery along the road.
