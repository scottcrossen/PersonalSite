These past few months have been a series of adventures. One adventure after the other.

Fall was beautiful. I got to wake up to awesome colors each morning

Sometimes it was overcast. That was really gorgeous too.

BYU students are really into "Pokemon Go"

I often raided my brothers work: "Lucid Software"

I took the Physics-department van out doing some errands for them. It was fun, but not as fun as driving my truck which I lovingly named "Ol' Blue".
