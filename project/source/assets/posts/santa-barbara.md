Note: this blog post represents the final (3/3) part of a road trip I went on during the summer of 2017.

After visiting friends and family in Clovis California (and right before heading home) my friend and I decided to visit the beach around Santa Barbara California.

The beach was really relaxing. It was fun to watch the surfers catch the waves around sunset. They have quite the camaraderie it seems. For dinner we ate some tasty range-fed burgers that we cooked over the coals of a fire we had made.

We also visited the university there (UCSB) and toured around campus until we found the world-renowned center for theoretical physics.

After leaving the beach we passed through Las Vegas Nevada on our way home to Provo Utah. Las Vegas was kind-of boring truthfully.
