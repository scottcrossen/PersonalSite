I work a lot during the weekdays so I can have fun during the weekends! In college I always felt like I was always doing school -- even on the weekends. Here at least I can take a break for a few days. For example, my friend Tyler Kharazi was in town one weekend so we went and hiked Glacier Point and Sentinel Dome in Yosemite.

I've also hiked around Mount Tamalpais (north of the Golden Gate).

I attended an Asian food night market.

And of course slacklining! I do a lot of slacklining.

It's really easy to go wherever I want because of my living situation, but most weekends I just go backpacking. I'll try documenting where I go in other blog posts.
