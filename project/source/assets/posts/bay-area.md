I was invited by Google to come interview with them. I took off school for a week
and spent a majority of that living with my Twin brother. He picked me up from the airport
and toured me around Facebook's campus. The last picture is taken on the roof of Facebook.

The next day I interviewed with Google. They provided my lunch and afterwards I
played volleyball on campus. Of course I had to take the classic Google campus pictures.

I had to spend the next day catching up on homework, but on Sunday I went to church in the bay.
I met some pretty cool people there. On Monday I got another tour of Google's campus by someone
I met there.

I also toured Stanford's campus. I really like cycling so I stole my brother's bike for the day. I probably look really skinny in these pictures.

At a different time I also interviewed with a company called BitGo. They're a promising startup in
Palo Alto that I may work at. Time well tell.  

The next day I flew back to Provo. It's quite funny that I could spend the morning at the beach
and the evening on the ski slopes.
