As the title alludes to, I still don't have a phone beacause it stopped working many months ago. I've still been doing a lot of stuff recently though -- I just don't have any pictures. As with my last post, I've decided to include links to other people's photos in this post. For proper attribution, please click on the link/photo to go to the original picture.

I got a really nice red Osprey Atmos backpack and so have been using that a lot. My pride and joy:

I backpacked into 'Wildcat Campground' and visited Alamere Falls.

I also saw the lighthouse there before it closed.

I've also spent a lot of time on the beach! Mostly I've just made bonfires.

I've also visited a lot of places around the bay area as part of bike trips with my brother Mark -- Like Santa Cruz or San Gregorio
