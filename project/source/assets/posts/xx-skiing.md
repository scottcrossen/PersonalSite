I took a class this semester that was suppose to be all about winter camping (BYU RECM 223R). Well, we didn't do any camping but it was still a really enjoyable experience -- especially when compared to all of the other courses I've taken over the years. We mostly cross-country skied every time we had class. I used to cross-country ski more when I was younger but this was the first time I've been on skis for probably ten years.

This picture is of our teacher Patti imparting her wisdom to us. As per usual no one is paying attention to what is probably life-saving information (I wouldn't know though -- I was busy taking pictures rather than listening).

Here's one of us skiing... or goofing around... or whatever we're doing.

We also learned how to cook in poor conditions. On this particular day we had to cook under a pavilion because it was raining and there were a bunch of knights -- yeah that's right knights -- all around that might try stabbing us if we ventured off. They were probably filming a movie to be honest.

In case you're curious, the header photo is of the place where I rented my gear every week (BYU Outdoors Unlimited). Those aren't cross-country ski boots but rather downhill ski boots.
