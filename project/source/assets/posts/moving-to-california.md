My phone broke late April of this year and so I've been phone-less for the past three months. I have nothing to take pictures with so I've decided to include links to other people's photos in this post. For proper attribution, please click on the link/photo to go to the original picture.

The past few months I've been busy building my "house" and managing my personal matters before leaving Utah. Even though I was really busy, I still had time to do fun things. I made it up to Spokane and Coeur d'Alene and also visited some hot springs around Springville Utah. I cycled a lot!

The Diamond Fork hot springs were great.

Eventually I packed my things and moved. On my way to the Bay Area I explored some parts of Utah and California that I've always been fond of. I have a very accommodating van so I just spent the nights in that.

I visited Lower Calf Creek Falls (Escalante) and Wall Street (Bryce Canyon).

I also made it close to Spooky and Peekaboo slot canyons and the Golden Cathedral (Escalante). There was a logistic problem and so I couldn't quite make it all the way, but I still enjoyed what little I saw.

I enjoyed Kanaraville Falls (all 5 of them -- the furthest one is the best).

I also visited "Big Springs" which is up the Zion Narrows. Of course I visted all the other day-hikes while in Zion.

Then there was Las Vegas. (I won't post much about that here).

I also visited all the day hikes in Seqoia and Kings Canyon which included the Moro Rock trail, the General Grant Trail, Tunnel Log, the chimney tree, the General Sherman Tree, Tharp's Log, and Crescent Meadow.

I ended my time in Yosemite where I repeated a few of my favorite attractions there.

Eventually I made it to the Bay Area! I'll start work on the 16th of July. Right now I'm just hanging with my brother and touring some of the local features. Below is a picture of "the wave organ".
