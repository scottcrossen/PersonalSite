Note: this blog post represents the intermediate (2/3) part of a road trip I went on during the summer of 2017.

After leaving San Francisco, my friend and I decided to go to Yosemite so that we could ultimately backpack the famous mist trail hike up to halfdome. Upon arriving at Yosemite we found that all the camp sites were full for the night - a finding that wasn't too surprising since the national park system has always seemed to me to be like the McDonald's of the wilderness.

The first full day in the park my friend and I spent seeing all of the pull-off attractions. This included Yosemite falls and Bridalveil falls. To get around we used the bus system there. Often, however, we had to hitch hike to get to better locations and sceneries.

The next full day we started early so that we could get a backpacking permit for the next two nights. Our plan was to backpack up to the little Yosemite valley and spend two nights there - one day to visit half-dome and one day to visit clouds rest. While getting our backpacking permits we met up with two girls from UCLA and we all decided to camp and hike together since our destinations were so similar. One trail I learned about while applying for this backpacking permit was called the "John Muir Trail". It's a 200+ mile hike that starts in the Yosemite valley and ends far outside of the park. We met some girls our age that were starting the trip that day. It's a trail that I think I would like to attempt one day.

One of the trails up to half dome is called the mist trail. It's aptly named because of how much mist the many waterfalls will throw up onto the trail. Because of the large amount of precipitation California received this year, we were completely soaked by the end of this trail. It may sound horrible but it was simply wonderful. We camped about four miles from the summit that night. We woke up the next morning to begin the climb.

We finally made it to the summit somewhere between mid-morning and early afternoon. To do this we had to climb up a steep mountainside made easier by helpful cables. At the top we witnessed a wedding take place.

After eating and enjoying the view we decided to head down the mountain.

After concluding our hike we went to Clovis California to visit my friend's family and to start the next main leg of our trip.
