For new years eve I took a trip down to Los Angeles.
I went with some friends from work.
I woke up near the beach. It was very warm.

I took a detour one day and toured Joshua Tree National Park.

I also visited the Google offices in LA and spent some time with my brother.

On the way back I visited Santa Barbara -- one of my favorite California cities.
