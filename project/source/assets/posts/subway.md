I was introduced to a facebook group called "Adventures with Will". Will, the
group leader, will often organize outdoor adventures and invite the group members
to them. For this adventure, we spent time in Zion National Park.
In particular we did the Subway and Angel's Landing.

We convened on an evening in Orem. I drove down with Will and after his car
literally threw a rod outside of the block, I got to ride on top of the tow truck.

All +30 people spent the night in a nice retired couple's house. It was cramped.
It was a three day trip and on the first day my sub-group did the Subway. It was
wonderful and truly amazing.

The next day we did Angels Landing. That was pretty cool too.
