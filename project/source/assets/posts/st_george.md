I wish I took more pictures of this trip because it was really great. Instead of a
break, BYU gives us a three day weekend which I spent with some buddies down in
St. George climbing in the Green Valley Gap Recreation Area. It was pretty fun. We camped
there and had a big bonfire too. The next morning we did some more climbing and went
into town to get some food. We skied at a resort called Brianhead that evening and spent
the night at a hotel that we got on discount. We had planned to do some hikes the next morning
(like Kolob Canyon and Kanarraville falls) but a few feet of snow hit us that night so we
had to drive home.
