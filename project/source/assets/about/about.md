# Background

I grew up in Spokane Washington, graduated High School in 2012, and currently attend Brigham Young University in Provo Utah where I am pursuing a B.S. degree in Physics as well as in Computer Science.

During the years of 2013-2015 I served a proselyting-type religious mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the state of South Carolina. I enjoyed this time of my life immensely and hope to go back there one day.

In 2015 I returned to school and am now finishing my bachelor's degree. I currently attend BYU where I have been privileged to perform faculty-mentored research in condensed matter physics on the topic of, among other things, electron spin coherence times. After my baccalaureate degree I will likely work as a software engineer or do post-grad studies in intellectual property law. I seem to have a natural proclivity and enjoyment in both of these areas.

When I have free time, I usually spend it taking advantage of all the things that Utah has to offer. For me, Utah is an outdoor paradise. The city of Provo itself is situated not-too-far from mountains, a lake, and a medium-sized city center. I enjoy hiking, back-packing, exploring, going on adventures, ham radio, and long-boarding.


# Skills and Abilities

I am first and foremost a hard worker. I have a great work ethic and I know how to motivate others to work as well. This is mostly because of my good time-management abilities and my driven personality. Moreover, I simply love to innovate. Both of my academic concentrations - Physics and Computer Science - lend themselves extremely well to problem solving and to finding creative solutions. In addition to my programming prowess and my physics knowledge, I am also very talented in all things technical. I've worked a variety of different jobs that have given me experience in everything from office skills to correct laser safety procedures. I'm a team-player. Though I am very self-reliant and know how to work alone, I also prefer to have others to collaborate and share work with.

# Interests and Hobbies

I enjoy living life to it's fullest. I find it very limiting to reduce what I enjoy to just a few activities. I believe that everything can be enjoyed if approached correctly. However, when I have free time I find myself drawn to the great distractions of Utah. In Provo - where I currently live - there are mountains, lakes, and a city-center all within a few minutes walk. In the past I've enjoyed shooting sports like archery and trap in addition to my long-standing love for ham radio. My fondest memories are back-packing to remote places and hitch-hiking during school breaks. As a scientist, I believe in the spirit of adventure and exploration - both in my free time and in my research.
