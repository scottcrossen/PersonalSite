# Background

I grew up in Spokane Washington where I graduated High School in 2012. In 2018 I graduated Summa Cum Laude (4.0 GPA) from Brigham Young University in Provo Utah with a B.S. degree in Physics as well as in Computer Science.

During the years of 2013-2015 I served a proselyting-type religious mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. This is common to most students that attend BYU and upon my return I was privileged to perform faculty-mentored research in condensed matter physics on the topic of, among other things, electron spin coherence times as they relate to quantum computing. Between school semesters I also participated in internships at small startup software companies. This helped me develop my skills as a computer programmer. After my baccalaureate degree I started my career as a software engineer at Google. I seem to have a natural proclivity and enjoyment for software development and I hope to work in this field indefinitely.

When I have free time, I usually spend it taking advantage of all the things that the outdoors have to offer. I enjoy cycling, backpacking, exploring, going on adventures, and kiteboarding.


# Skills and Abilities

I am first and foremost a hard worker. I have a great work ethic and I know how to motivate others to work as well. This is mostly because of my good time-management abilities and my driven personality. Moreover, I simply love to innovate. Both of my academic concentrations - Physics and Computer Science - lend themselves extremely well to problem solving and to finding creative solutions. In addition to my programming prowess and my physics knowledge, I am also very talented in all things technical. I've worked a variety of different jobs that have given me experience in everything from office skills to correct laser safety procedures. I'm a team-player. Though I am very self-reliant and know how to work alone, I also prefer to have others to collaborate and share work with.

# Interests and Hobbies

I enjoy living life to it's fullest. I find it very limiting to reduce what I enjoy to just a few activities. I believe that everything can be enjoyed if approached correctly. However, when I have free time I find myself drawn to the great distractions of the outdoors. In Provo -- where I used to live -- there are mountains, lakes, and a city-center all within a few minutes walk. In the Bay Area  -- where I now live -- there are great cycling courses and a large waterfront perfect for kiteboarding. In the past I've enjoyed shooting sports like archery and trap in addition to my long-standing love for ham radio. My fondest memories are back-packing to remote places and hitch-hiking during school breaks. As a scientist, I believe in the spirit of adventure and exploration -- both in my free time and in my research.
