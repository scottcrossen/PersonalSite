I grew up in Spokane Washington, graduated High School in 2012, and currently attend Brigham Young University in Provo Utah where I am pursuing a B.S. degree in Physics as well as in Computer Science.

During the years of 2013-2015 I served a proselyting-type religious mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the state of South Carolina. I enjoyed this time of my life immensely and hope to go back there one day.

In 2015 I returned to school and am now finishing my bachelor's degree. I currently attend BYU where I have been privileged to perform faculty-mentored research in condensed matter physics on the topic of, among other things, electron spin coherence times. After my baccalaureate degree I intend to do post-grad studies in intellectual property law. I seem to have a natural proclivity and enjoyment in this area.

When I have free time, I usually spend it taking advantage of all the things that Utah has to offer. For me, Utah is an outdoor paradise. The city of Provo itself is situated not-too-far from mountains, a lake, and a medium-sized city center. I enjoy hiking, back-packing, exploring, going on adventures, ham radio, and long-boarding.
